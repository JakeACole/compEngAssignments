Two MikroC programs written in my Computer Engineering course

Real Time Clock - Programs a PICFlash board to act as a stopwatch, push-button switches are used to interact with the board and the timer is displayed on an LCD screen.

Security System - Programs a PICFlash board to act as a security system, push-button switches are used to emulate the states of an alarm system (armed, triggered, disarmed), the LCD displays the current system state to the user.
